This portfolio contains a series of projects prepared by Maja Andersen (sdg196), Marcus Jensen (csw615), and Sarah Bouzidi (wsf963) for the course "Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis" at the University of Copenhagen, Spring 2024. Each project showcases different aspects of economic modeling, numerical analysis, and data handling.


The repository contains the following projects:
Inaugural project: This project investigates an exchange economy with two consumers and two goods, focusing on parameter values, utility functions, and restrictions. It simulates different scenarios to identify Pareto improvements and socially optimal allocations. Key aspects include market clearing prices and consumer utility optimization under various constraints.


Data project: This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and unemployment rates in Denmark, using data from Statistics Denmark (NAN1 for GDP and AUL01 for employment). By uncovering trends and correlations, it provides insights into how changes in GDP impact unemployment, aiding policymakers and economists in strategy formulation.


Model project: This project explores the Solow Model to examine long-term economic growth, focusing on capital accumulation, labor growth, and technological progress. By analyzing these factors, the project provides insights into the mechanisms driving economic development and the role of different variables in sustaining growth, including an extension that adds human capital.


Exam, Summer 2024: This final project analyzes various economic models to understand the impact of policies on market equilibrium, career choices, and interpolation techniques. We examine a production economy, simulate career choices with utility optimization, and explore barycentric interpolation for function approximation.
