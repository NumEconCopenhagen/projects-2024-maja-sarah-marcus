**Introduction to the inaugural project: Analysis of an exchange economy** 
This project is the first project prepared by Maja Andersen (sdg196), Marcus Jensen (csw615) and Sarah Bouzidi (wsf963) in the course Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis at the University of Copenhagen, Spring 2024.

In this project we investigate an exchange economy with consumers, A and B, and goods, x1 and x2. We start by setting up the various parameter values that are fundamental to solving the task as well as including the applicable utility functions and restrictions. 

The purpose of the project is to simulate different scenarios with two agents in an exchange economy given different endowments. The project gives us an insight into which allocations are Pareto improvements or socially optimal. 

Through the project, we investigate various aspects of the economic model, which includes determinations of market clearing prices, exploration of different allocation scenarios under different pricing strategies, and studies of outcomes when consumers optimize their utility under different constraints.
