#Introduction to the initial project: Analysis of an exchange economy
This project is the first project prepared by Maja Andersen (sdg196), Marcus Jensen (csw615) and Sarah Bouzidi (wsf963) in the course Introduction to programming and numerical analysis at the University of Copenhagen, Spring 2024.

In this project we investigate a exchange economy with consumers, A and B, and for goods, x1 and x2. We start by setting up the various parameter values that are fundamental to solving the task. Including the applicable utility functions and restrictions.

The purpose of the project is to create a simulation of different scenarios where two agents in an exchange economy based on different endowments. The project gives an insight into which allocations are Pareto improvements or socially optimal.

Through the project, we investigate various aspects of the economic model, which include determinations of market clearing prices, exploration of different allocation scenarios under different pricing strategies, and studies of outcomes when consumers optimize their utility under different constraints.
