Introduction to the Inaugural Project: Analyzing an Exchange Economy

In this project, we delve into the intricacies of an exchange economy featuring two consumers, A and B, and two goods, x1 and x2. Our journey begins by establishing the foundational elements of this economy, including the initial endowments and utility functions for each consumer, setting the stage for a comprehensive analysis of market dynamics and individual strategies.

The primary objective of this project is to apply theoretical economic concepts through practical numerical solutions and simulations. By solving and simulating a pre-specified economic model, we aim to understand the behavior of consumers within the economy under varying price and endowment scenarios. This analysis will be supported by visualizations that illustrate the equilibrium states and potential Pareto improvements.

The analytical process will be structured around a series of tasks, each designed to explore different aspects of the economic model. These include determining the market-clearing prices, exploring various allocation scenarios under different pricing strategies, and investigating the outcomes when consumers optimize their utility subject to various constraints.

This project will not only enhance our understanding of economic theories but also improve our skills in structuring a code project, documenting code effectively, and presenting complex results comprehensibly. The insights gained here will form a critical part of our exam portfolio, with opportunities for iterative improvement through peer feedback.

Embarking on this inaugural project promises a deep dive into economic analysis, enriched with practical application and critical evaluation, preparing us for more complex challenges in the field of economics.
