**Introduction to Model Project** 

**Model Analysis project**
This project is the third project prepared by Maja Andersen (sdg196), Marcus Jensen (csw615) and Sarah Bouzidi (wsf963) in the course Introduction to programming and numerical analysis at the University of Copenhagen, Spring 2024.

This project explores the Solow Model, a fundamental economic model that examines long-term economic growth. By analyzing key factors such as capital accumulation, labor or population growth, and technological progress, the Solow Model helps us understand how these elements interact to influence the overall growth of an economy. 

This analysis provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving economic development and the role of different variables in sustaining long-term growth.

HER SKAL VI KOMME IND PÅ DEN NYE MODEL VI KOMMER TIL AT BRUGE OG DEN EXTENSION VI GØR BRUG AF - RET NÅR VI ER FÆRDIGE.

The results of the project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb.
Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
