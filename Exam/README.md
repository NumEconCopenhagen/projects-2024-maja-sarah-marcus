Exam Economics summer 2024 is the final project prepared by Maja Andersen (sdg196), Marcus Jensen (csw615) and Sarah Bouzidi (wsf963) in the course Introduction to programming and numerical analysis at the University of Copenhagen.

This project analyzes different economic models to understand the impact of various policies and decisions on market equilibrium, career choices, and interpolation techniques.
In the first part, we examine a production economy with two firms and a single consumer. We check market clearing conditions for a range of prices, find equilibrium prices $p_1​$ and $p_2$​, and determine the optimal tax rate ($\tau$) and lump-sum transfer ($T$) that maximize social welfare while considering the social cost of carbon emissions.

The second part focuses on a career choice model for graduates choosing between different career tracks. We simulate expected and realized utilities for each career, incorporating scenarios with prior information from friends and the possibility of switching careers after gaining experience.
The final part explores barycentric interpolation to approximate the value of a function given a set of data points. We define random points in the unit square, use barycentric coordinates to interpolate new values, and evaluate the accuracy of the method.

We have used AI tools to optimize our codes and constructing the figure that displays the 3D-plots.
Throughout this project, we utilized AI tools to optimize our code and construct the figures that display the 3D plots. The results of the project can be seen from running exam_2024.ipynb. Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
